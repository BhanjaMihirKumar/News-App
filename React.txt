Q]Method in React?
Ans- 
1. rendor() mehotd - it is required for class based comp. to render the dom.
                 - rendor method should be pure.
2. componentDidMount() method - it run after component output has been render.
                - here we fatch API.
                - here we set state
3. componentDidUpdate() method - when we update our comp.(prop change or state change) then we use this method
4. componentWillMount() method - it is use just before destroy the comp.

NOTE-
-------------------------
HOOKS-by the use of hooks what ever we use the features in class based that component
      we use in function based component also.
     -by the use of hooks without creating class we can write react features.
     -some hooks are= useState-here u update the state and also set the initail value of state
                      useEffect-side effect
                      useContext-
                      useRef- it return mutabale reference obj under which (dot).correcnt property available
